# memerator-sdk-java
java api library wrapper for memerator

So far, 2 of all the api methods are available, login() and getRandomMeme(). Hope to get more pushed out soon!

Also, you will need to get the following [JSON package](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.json/json) for the library to work. Androids Dev's should already have this preinstalled.
